</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I wanted to install Intellij today to build an Android App I was thinking of. Just for kicks, because I'm sure something like my idea exists out there, but hey I'm looking for jobs, might as well practice Java.</p>
<p>I used Eclipse in school, but I really didn't enjoy how slow it was. So, I wanted to try out Intellij. Doink! It's not in a PPA (Personal Package Archives). Well, I said to myself, today is the day I grow up and start doing things "right".</p>
<h1>Step 1: Download and Unpack</h1>
<p>Went to the website, downloaded it. First obstacle check, second obstacle how do I unpack thee?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>tar -xzf download.tar.gz
</pre></div>


<p>Break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tar</code> an archiving/unarchiving utility.</li>
<li><code>-x</code> extract that package</li>
<li><code>-z</code> put it through <code>gzip</code> because it has a <code>.gz</code> ending.</li>
<li><code>-f</code> output it to a file? I'm not really sure about this guy, but it works!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Step 2: Move that Folder Somewhere not Annoying</h1>
<p>I decided <code>/usr/local</code> was a good spot, because it was close to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, and there were some other utilities like heroku sitting in there as well.</p>
<h1>Step 3: Access that Program from Anywhere (Like You Know What You're All About).</h1>
<p>So this was my first time making a Symbolic Link, which is like a Windows Shortcut, but I was rather well pleased with the results, because I didn't have to further clutter my $PATH variable.</p>
<p>Since <code>/usr/local/bin</code> is already on our path, anything I throw in there is accessible from the command line; no matter which directory I'm in. IntelliJ has a bash script in it's /bin folder that you use to run the program, so I decided to put a symbolic link to that script in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> using the <code>ln</code> command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ln -s /source/path/to/file /dest/path/to/link
</pre></div>


<p>Et voila, symbolic link, and I can just type <code>intellij</code> or whatever I called the link file, and bam Intellij. I could have even called it <code>stupidj</code> and it would still work, but it's not stupid so I'll call it <code>intellij</code>. Oh yeah, and the <code>-s</code> makes it a symbolic link, rather than a hard link. This just means we can swap out that file for newer versions, but if we still keep the same name our link still points to it.</p>
