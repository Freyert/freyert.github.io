Mandarin Chinese has really started to catch my interest as a learning objective. Career wise, it often seems that companies see launching in China as a major milestone (why not India?). There are also a slew of very interesting and innovative open source projects originating in China (vuejs, TiDB), and intersting companies to work for such as ByteDance. Personally, I have always enjoyed learning new programming languages and paradigms because I often learn new approaches to old problems. Chinese in general requires different approaches to learning and I think I could potentially transfer those approaches over to other things I want to learn. Finally, when I visit Chinese spaces (groceries, restaurants, a Chinese coworker's desk) I would like to operate more on their terms, but also show my respect for their space and culture. I also want to do the same with Spanish since there are so many spanish speaking spaces near me.

# What?

I have tried milling through DuoLingo in the past, and I realize now it's not good for learning Chinese. My specific issue is that I see "completeing all lessons" as my goal, which I have never, ever achieved in any language. Fortunately there are more achievable certifications for Mandarin Chinese I can aim for. Namely, I will aim for the HSK1 certification this year.

HSK1 _should_ be very easy:

* Memorize 150 words.
* Character memorization is not required, Pinyin are provided.

I plan to take the test in person as well so will need to register with a local test center ([_Improve Mandarin: Official HSK Test Centers in the USA_](https://improvemandarin.com/hsk-test-centers-usa/)).

# When?

I expect I should be gaining confidence in my competency around February 19 which is the registartion deadline for the paper based test on March 18. _Improve Mandarin_ has a nice rule of thumb when deciding how much preparation time is needed:

> As a general rule, it takes approximately 2-3 hours of studying Chinese to earn one point on the HSK tests (level 4-6). To figure out a study plan, subtract your score on your HSK practice test from your score goal. Then calculate the approximate number of study hours you’ll need to put in to reach your goal.
> ...
> For example, if you still wanted to earn 210 points, your score goals could be: Listening 72, Reading 69, Writing 69. You can spend more time on your weaknesses. In the end, you’ll spend the same time learning and earn 210 points in total.
> [_Improve Mandarin: HSK Global Test Dates (2023) for Internet & Paper-based HSK Tests_](https://improvemandarin.com/hsk-test-dates/)

So let's say I'm starting at 0 and want to score 300. If I study ~5 hours a week that would take 60 weeks :(. These are all estimates so I imagine after a week or two I can take a practice exam and see where I really stand and where I stand to gain.

I should probably aim to take a sample test every two weeks now that I think about it. Just so I can receive consistent feedback on the quality of my study.
