## Reflections on [Public goals, career frameworks, and books](https://refactoring.fm/p/public-goals-career-frameworks-and)

I _loved_ this read. I've been doing end of year reviews and so this has really been on my mind. I've always found
end of year review processes to be more painful than helpful. I think this is mostly because I've been using the wrong
frame of reference when observing these processes.


Using the "Purpose of a system is what it does" frame of reference I generally observe that end of year and mid year reviews
do the following:

1. Negotiate salary adjustments.
2. Negotiate promotions.
3. Identify team members falling behind and generate a development plan.

Sure there are development plans mentioned, but that really is not the sort of development most engineers want or need.
A system that provides consistent, upward improvement for engineers instead of an emergency based development plan.

### Values alone do not an engineer make

I see companies often use "values" to center employee development conversations. For example, when I worked at IBM valuing
"wild ducks" was often printed on posters I would see in the office. The idea behind these valuing these ducks was to 
promote people bringing wild and innovative ideas.

Honestly, though the concept may seem silly it's quite effective. Think about, a leadership team needs to shape a company
culture for thousands of employees. Leadership teams do not have the time to manage each team individually. Using the power
of "meme" values they can spread a common cultural focus quickly and easily. Remember, at IBM I was just one engineer, but 
if I said "wild duck" on any IBM campus they would know what I meant.

The ironic element here is that these words are also cliche: "a phrase or opinion that is overused and betrays a lack of original thought."
Using the term "wild duck" in some ways _softens_ our ability to be _original_ thinkers. At its worst these sorts of "value jargon"
can be used as "thought terminating cliches" or "group jargon".
In fact [_How Cults Use Language to Control_](https://youtu.be/3ZGTT_Vy_Bw?si=0n5QLMxZ_iODfZzN) specifically highlight's Amazon's
values framework as an example of cult like "loaded language" applied to business.

### Don't stop that thought

Just because cults use "value jargon" does not mean we should avoid it altogether. Without these techniques, centering
hundreds of teams would pose a significant challenge.

When upper level management meets with managers to discuss how much of a "wild duck" there employees are a manager may
find themselves thinking about what that means for the first time. What makes a senior "wild duck" vs. an entry level "wild duck".

My personal thesis after reading _Public goals, career frameworks, and books_ is that I should establish my _own_ leveling
system within my team that grounds itself in not only the cultural systems given to me by the larger organization, but _also_
by reckoning with the reality of the work our team needs to do.

Examining what do I understand an associate vs. senior level "wild duck" to act like. Together, week to week, an engineer and I
can review progress and set goals for each week; thus creating a tight feedback cycle for iterative improvement. The benefit
of grounding this iterative improvement in the larger company values is that now I have the tools to speak the language of 
upper management in order to promote engineers that I have been continually developing.

### Don't just follow the org level competencies

If competencies/tracks are set very high in an organization's hierarchy they can be extremely vauge and unable to adapt.
Creating a perfect "one size fits all" competency track is not really feasible; too many concerned parties, too many factors,
and too much time required to make.

Think about it: should there be one competency track for front end engineers, backend engineers, database engineers, AI engineers?
These all require wildly different skills and yet from an HR perspective these are all L1, L2, L3, etc. engineers. These levels are
for HR leveling, _not_ the development of engineering talent.

Engineering managers should build their own frameworks with their team. These continually evolving then bridge the gap between
engineering development and HR career leveling.
