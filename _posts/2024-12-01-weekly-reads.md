title: Weekly Reading December 1, 2024

I've been pretty lax on this, but watched some videos that
reminded me of my goal to read more each week and journal
about it.

The [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) has been haunting me ever since
I learned about it and I could feel the influence in 
Peter van Hardenberg's [_Why Can't We Make Simple Software?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czzAVuVz7u4).

I especially enjoyed Peter's talk because it dove into _complexity_.
Why do systems become complex, categorizing those factors, and suggesting
methods to remediate complexity.

I need to watch it again, but it definitely connected to
problems I see again and again.

## The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast

* [_Efficient scaleups in 2024 vs 2021: Sourcegraph (with CEO & Co-founder Quinn Slack)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMD_jKMePDM)
* [_Promotions and tooling at Google (with Irina Stanescu, Ex-Google)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf3erhnXNTE)

The conversation with Quinn Slack helped tremendously to understand more
this sea change we have all felt in tech. The greedy market in 2021 is not
the lean market we have in 2024.

Companies were generally blinded by their desire to compete in a market flush
with cash that employees were hired without any _clear value proposition_.
It really confirms my opposition to this "move fast and break things" mentality.

What do I prefer instead? Move deliberately and iterate. If I were to find myself
in a 2021 situation again I would start by asking: "why do you want me to hire and what will I do with these engineers".
Generally a good question to keep at the core of any hiring initiative.

I also found it interesting that Sourcegraph made a major pivot into AI assisted
coding. Cody is the _second_ product in Sourcegraph's lenghty history so we can see
how critical adoption of AI can be for some companies.

Irina's interview really helped me remember how I should think about my career
and I really want to share it with other engineers to help them reflect on their path.

## Plain Text Accounting

Finally, I want to be a bit more thoughtful about my personal finances.
I've tried a lot of automated systems like mint. I found that I often
interacted initially with these systems, but then quickly began ignoring them.

Plain Text accounting is interesting to me because it requires a bit more effort
on my part. I had to process most of the transactions and develop rules for categorizing
transactions.

I very much enjoy how easy it is to make new "subaccounts" to group transactions into.
My plan is to eventually use this to better track expenses related to assets.

Anyways, I ended up using [hledger](https://github.com/trygvis/hledger/tree/master).

And don't forget: using a tool like this I control my data.
