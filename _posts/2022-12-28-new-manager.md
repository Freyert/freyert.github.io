I've been an engineering manager, actively, for about a week now. Being a rookie, I'm making some rookie mistakes, but making mistakes, being uncomfortable, and growing is why I stepped up into the management role.

Now, not every bit of feedback I receive is worth writing about, but the more I mulled over the feedback I just received the more I realized I needed a management thesis on the topic. Specifically, I was using language that was perceived as dominating or using calls to my authority as an engineering manager to get what I wanted.

## Best Intentions

My coworker is 100% correct. I was using language that could be perceived as dominating to seek outcomes _I_ felt were best for the team. Here's a contrived version:

> As a manager, I think we should explore solution X because we already have a license and if we don't I'm going to put my foot down.

There are two problems with this:

1. The statement does not focus on solving a particular problem and therefore obscures the value of following the advice.
2. I prefixed the statement with "as a manager" which can be perceived as a call to authority.
3. "Putting your foot down" is using a threat to achieve dominance of the situation.

In my mind it felt much more innocent (as a manager -> user story) and even a little silly (putting your foot down) at the time. What's important is it did not feel that way to other people.

## Dominance is not the Answer

It was suggested that I read Charity Major's post [_The Hierarchy is Bullshit (And Bad for Business)_](https://charity.wtf/2022/09/23/the-hierarchy-is-bullshit-and-bad-for-business/). I have a lot of issues with this post:

* Charity Majors sits near the top of her company's hierarchy.
* Hierarchy _is_ affirmed to be a useful tool in the article.
* The article is unnecessarily reductive and maybe even a little condescending when it comes to _why_ people choose to seek promotion.
    * There are better articles on this subject and covering it in the same blog post distracts from the post's unique value.

However, the _heart_ of Charity's article is tremendous: *we often mix heirarchy with social dominance*. If someone sits lower than you on a reporting chain you might assume you have more power and vice versa. This belief is fiction and counterproductive.

## Hierarchal Non-Fiction

In reality, a manager and their report are both playing the same game with different cards. We aim to deliver value for our team, our company, our investors, and the communities we participate in.

A manager might work towards this objective by coaching reports, organizing feedback rounds, faciliating team trainings, and managing team budgets.

A team member might work towards this objective by writing code, coaching peers and juniors, documenting work, writing project plans, etc.

If a team member percieves the manager behaving in a way that undermines the main objective, the team member has the right and responsbility to provide feedback to the manager. Otherwise the manager will unwittingly harm the team therefore directly defeating the manager's mandate.

If a manager is "powerful", but does harm to the team then the manager is ineffective. In this situation, the manager's reports have the authority and responsibility to engage their manager's manager and higher until the issue resolves. The point is, though a person may work at the base of the org chart, it's just a chart. Power comes in many shapes, sizes, and from many directions.

## Productive Hierarchies

I've worked on a few teams with dominators, and if I'm being honest have attempted (and still do) to dominate team decisions. I know what it's like to work in a culture of dominance, but also to have empathy for dominators.

When I felt dominated:
* I spoke less at meetings.
* I participated less.
* I felt I needed approval for every decision.
* I dreaded coming to work.
* I found a new job.

On the other hand, when I dominate a discussion it's either because I find it really engaging, or else the direction we are going makes me very anxious. Speaking those feelings out loud would be more productive than attempting to dominate the discussion and alienate team members.

More importantly, as a manager my contributions moves away from directly contributing to what we are building and instead emphasises how we work as a team. If I were to aim for total control of every decision two things would happen:

1. Everyone would be miserable
2. We would get far less done together because I would lock every decision.

Effective teams and hierarchies, on the other hand, define boundaries that allow everyone to operate independently and with authority; while also respecting the wants and needs of everyone involved. In other words: "A manager should help everyone make good decisions on their own".

## Making Good Decisions

I'm going to take another stab at helping my team find the best decision for the team. Remember I was trying to convince them to explore a particular solution:

> As a manager, I think we should explore solution X because we already have a license and if we don't I'm going to put my foot down.

Instead I could raise my hand and say:

> I'm worried about how we are thinking about roadmap feature X.
> 
> One of our team principles, is to value "problem focus" rather than "feature focus". We value problem focus because problem focus helps us understand the value of roadmap items and focuses us to deliver that value.
>
> And don't forget to seek continuous improvement (another one of our team principles)! I want you all to see the value of your effort as soon as possible.

Instead of _telling_ everyone _what to think_ or even _how to think_, I am specifically _asking_ everyone to re-evaluate _how they are thinking_. Also, please note that I am _reminding_ everyone not only of the principles, but why we agreed on them in the first place.

Unfortunately, I omit how much I care about wasteful expense in my second rendition, but if everyone applies good principles I might not have to. If I did need to assert my feelings on spending, there might be better arenas for doing so.

In the end, I hope that everyone learns to make decisions that efficiently pursue our team's objectives, but also that these decisions derive from reasoning the entire team respects. Sometimes you have to make a decision without your manager, your team, or even another person altogether. It's important that everyone understands and respects the reasoning for a decision if they must live with the consequences of the choice.

## Conclusion

No one wants to work in a "dominance" focused culture. Well at least not me. A culture where everyone knows how to "make good choices", choices the team respects and values, on their own is far preferable.
