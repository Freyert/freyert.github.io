title: Staying Up to Date
---

I have begun to realize there are many, many, many
places a Software Engineer may need to follow to stay
in sync with their team and their work.

My current list of places I need to follow at work
are:

1. GitHub
2. Jira
3. Google Calendar
4. Google Tasks
5. Confluence
6. Slack
7. E-Mail

## Goals

### Single Pane

Ideally, I would have just _one_ pane to observe all
events. Everyone loves communicating in slack for rapid
communication, but there are some integrations that do
not quite function up to snuff.

The GitHub Slack integration for example does not support
some essential filtering that e-mail notifications can.
For example there is a _strong_ request from the community for the
Slack integration to support [Notifications by Team](https://github.com/integrations/slack/issues/1868#issuecomment-2142539776).
Using e-mail filtering I can easily receive notifications by team.

### Duplicated Functionality

Google Tasks and Confluence have the notion of "todo" items.
I use these _a lot_. I add a "todo" item to a Confluence
page or a Google Document then it shows up in my
Confluence/Google task list.

Then I also have Jira to stay ontop of which is a much more
complex example of a todo tracker.

I do not imagine that there exists a way to manage all these
"todos" in one place, but perhaps I can setup a quick workflow
to process them all each day. Perhaps receive notifications
when a new "todo" is added for me in my E-Mail to get that
"single pane".

### Noise Management

GitHub can be _very_ noisy. I learned recently that I was
automatically watching any new repository created in any
organization I was a part of.

This flooded my notifications with a ton of noise so I
missed anytime someone mentioned me or updated a discussion
I was participating in.

Jira, Confluence, and more all suffer from this noise. The
question then is: what should I watch and why?

### Responding in a Timely Fashion

I respond to Slack messages within a few minutes, but I
check e-mail only once or twice each day. If e-mail becomes
my single pane then I will not respond to some requests
quickly enough.

Ideally, myself or any other engineer would set their GitHub
integarion for Slack to notify them _as soon as_ possible that
their teammate has opened a pull request. Then the review
can happen sooner and therefore work resumes earlier.

## Conclusion

Thinking about how to organize this is _tricky_. GitHub is
the most important for engineers so I plan to write one guide
on the topic.

Then there is Calendar management which is so, so key.

Jira I think also deserves its own, but Google Tasks and Confluence
are so similar they might be done in one.
