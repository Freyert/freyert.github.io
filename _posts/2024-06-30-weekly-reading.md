title: Weekly Reading June 30, 2024
---

Finally getting my RSS reader setup and have been reading a
lot. Quite a bit from the origins of some blogs.

My goal is to write a weekly summary of what I read so I
can easily review some of the hits in the future. This
way the information will have a greater chance of
creating actual value.

## refactoring.fm

* [Thoughts on Code Reviews üîç](https://refactoring.fm/p/thoughts-on-code-reviews)

This one was really thought provoking to me. I'm not sure I agree with _all_ of it, but
I also think I work on different systems than the author.

Excited to assess code review process at work. See if there is anything to change up!

## Farnam Street

### [Chesterton's Fence: A Lesson in Thinking](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/)

This hit home for me. I often want to "remove" or change
systems at work.

"Chesterton's Fence" is a parable that recommends understanding
_why_ something was done in the first place before removing it.

If you still want to remove it after gaining that understanding
then you are better equipped to do so! Maybe you decided not to
and saved yourself a lot of pain.

## Matt Might Behavior Management

Three articles from Matt Might all concerning behavior management.

I really skimmed these, but I thought they were quite useful.

The general thesis is that discipline is not the way. Instead
set your environment up for success.

* [HOWTO: Control Yourself](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-control-yourself/)
* [HOWTO: Avoid Temptation --  why avoiding temptation is harder than yout hink](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-avoid-temptation/)
* [HOWTO: Change your behavior](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-change-your-behavior/)

the short format of the articles.
