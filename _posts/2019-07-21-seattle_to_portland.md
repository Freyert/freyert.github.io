title: Seattle to Portland 2019
---

This one's about my first Seattle to Portland ride. It's about what I did, what I learned, and what I recommend for next time.

## Preparation

I had to fly all the way across the country so there was a lot to get ready here.

### Hotel

I was fortunate enough to have friends who live near the start, but if I were to purchase a room I would make sure
it was close to the light rail and University of Washington Station where the ride starts.

The light rail will take you all the way from the airport to University of Washington Station
and buses can take you anywhere else you need to go. You might want to pick up an Orca Card if
you plan on taking the bus a lot.

### Bike

I rented my bike from [Montlake Bicycles](https://www.montlakebike.com). I went for the Road Premium for 4 days
which ended up at $185. I was very worried about picking up the bike, but when I showed up at the shop the pulled my
order straight away and even had spare pedals to work with my LOOK cleats. They seemed to have a good system for rental cleats
and there was no extra charge. I wish I had asked about this before hand, but it turned out alright. In the end they gave me a 
very solid Liv with disk brakes. While Liv is definitely a women's cycling brand it was a great ride and the disk brakes were 
cool to try out.

One thing I would have done differently here is send my bike back on Sunday and pay [Montlake Bicycles](https://www.montlakebike.com) to pick it up for $35. I also would have flown back from Portland because it's a cool city itself
and I would have saved on the shuttle.

While I enjoyed trying a new bike, I want to do a lot more traveling with my bike. A bike box is definitely in my future.
Alaska Airlines has a partnership with STP where riders get to check their bikes for free.

My friend also recommended checking out [Spinlister](https://www.spinlister.com/). You can borrow someone's bike for a rental
fee which is generally cheaper than shops. It definitely seems like it takes some discretion and communicating beforehand is a
good idea. You might be able to come out with a nice bike for a good price.

Special note: I also brought my own seat because you never know what you will get and they are easy to take off and adjust.

### Luggage

STP will portage 2 large bags to your chosen sleeping destination for the night and to the end of the ride. I only
discovered this a day before the ride so my packing was not the best.

You can easily get away with one bag, but you may need a second one if you need to pack a tent yourself. My friends
had a tent I could borrow so that was one less bag I had to check at the airport. There are also hotels in Centralia and Chehalis
so camping equipment can also be optional.

The weather was consistently a nice ~75F and sunny so there wasn't really need for me to carry a backpack with
gear, and there were plenty of stops with snacks. I could have easily done the ride with just the pockets on my back for the day.


## Day 1

We got cracking at around 6:00 AM. We had a kind of a hurried and rushed morning because we hadn't opened our race packets
which had tags for us to put on our luggage, as well as numbers on our bike, jersey, and helmet.

My friends and I rode the Burke-Gilman trail to the start of the race and saw lots of other cyclists heading out for Portland.
Everyone's energy is pretty high at this point and one passing cyclist yelled out, "THIS IS GLORIOUS"!

When we got to the start we loaded our bags in the track for Chehalis and got in line at the starting line. After waiting only
a few minutes the line directors sent us on our way.

There's a lot I could talk about: cruising around Lake Washington, the Volunteer who had ridden the past 5 years, but had to
go to a wedding that day, families riding with their children, or riding through a military base. What you really need to know
is the entire route is _very_ flat and is generally some of the easiest riding I've ever done. If you can you should try
to motor up hills though because there is a wide variety of fitness and experience on the ride. I often saw folks dismounting
on hills in droves or just struggling a lot which lead to big packs that could easily fall over.

Also, try to get into Centralia to hang out for dinner, but camp in Chehalis. Centralia seemed like a big party, but we passed
through it.

One last thing about Day 1: lots of riders go by themselves so it can be really easy to make new friends! We met our new friend
codename "Peppermint" who told us about her [Peppermint Cycling Co.](https://en.peppermintcycling.com/collections/tops-1) jersey
and a bunch of [Bike and Build Alumni](https://bikeandbuild.org/). We also met a lot of good people from the 
[Major Taylor Project](https://www.cascade.org/learn/major-taylor-project).

## Day 2

There was a lot more road riding than on the first day (which had a lot of trails and closed roads). The roads were a bit
bumpier, hotter, and higher traffic. We were glad we had gone the extra miles to Chehalis the day before, but getting
on the road early on Day 2 is probably even more important than on Day 1.

Highlights are the Lewis and Clark bridge on highway 433 over the Columbia River (what a steep bridge! lots of things to catch
wheels as well), and the bridge into Portland. Roads were pretty bumpy, Highway 30 is real busy.

The last rest stop before Portland had no shade and was very hot. There were one or two trees that had shade and all kinds of
riders were huddling together to take advantage of it. Kind of a nice way to meet people, but also a little stressful. We took
a coffee stop at a Starbucks afterwards to pick up a little energy. Made my gut feel a little off, but it definitely helped
crush the last 30 miles of the ride. Paced a Prius through most of Portland off of the caffeine.

Last thing to know is that the finish just suddenly appears. When you see tall buildings all around you that means it's getting
close. Slow down. We saw a lot of collisions and accidents in the finish tunnel which is a kind of cage of doom.

## The End

This is an awesome ride and I would definitely do it again. Like I said it is really easy if you are in decent shape and take
your time.
